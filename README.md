# 🎵 Spotify Music Recommendation System

This project predicts whether a user will like a song based on its musical features such as danceability, energy, valence, and tempo.  
It uses **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing and feature selection from Spotify dataset
- Model training and evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC
- Visualization of model performance

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms, time_signature, liked


## 📈 Model Accuracy
The final Random Forest model achieved around **85–90% accuracy** after proper stratified training.
NOte:-the model is showing 100% here because tis has onlyh a small portion of dataframe. You can find the exact reading in the mid of the code.
